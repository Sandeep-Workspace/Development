Use Hibernate for Validation which is compliant with JSR 303/309
http://wwww.hibernate.org/validator

Separate project from hibernate for validation and is fully compliant with Java's bean validation API.

we need Javax validation jar for validation, you need to download it separately.
Also @NotNull does not work so @NotEmpty should be used.
