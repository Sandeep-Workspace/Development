Use Hibernate for Validation which is compliant with JSR 303/309
http://wwww.hibernate.org/validator

Separate project from hibernate for validation and is fully compliant with Java's bean validation API.

we need Javax validation jar for validation, you need to download it separately.
Also @NotNull does not work so @NotEmpty should be used.

@InitBinder
===========================
@InitBinder annotation works as preprocessor.
It will pre-process each web request to our controller.
Method annotated with @InitBinder is executed.

Register Custom editor in controller
StringTrimmerEditor: removes whitespace -leading and trailing. It is defined in Spring API.

StringTrimmerEditor stringTrimmerEditor = new StringTrimmerEditor(true); here true means trim to null.

registerCustomEditor(register as custome editor) it will pre process every string form data ,removes leading and trailing whitespace. 
If string has only whitespace trim it to null.

Regular Expressions:
======================
A sequence of characters that define a search pattern.
This pattern is used to find or match strings.

Regular expressions is like its own language.

regex tutorial:
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/regex/

To understand this:
validate a postal code:
Add a new input field on our form for: Postal Code
User can only enter 5 chars/digit
Apply regular expression
