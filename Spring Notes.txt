Model: Spring Model is a container for your application data.
In your controller you can put anything in model, strings,objects,info from database etc
your view page can access data from Model.

HttpServletRequest holds html form data.
(HttpServletRequest request, Model model)

To get parameter from request object: request.getParameter();
To add parameter to Model object: model.addAttribute("Field name",value);

@RequestParam annotation
(@RequestParam("studentName") String theName,Model model)

Spring will read param from request: studentName and Bind it to the variable theName

If multiple controllers are there and if they have same url for methods you want to run particular controller method then use @RequestMapping on controller level 
as well. It will reduce ambiguity  for different controller having same RequestMapping for differentmethod.
