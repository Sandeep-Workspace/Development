Dependency Injection: Outsource creation and injection of objects to an external entity(Spring Container).

Spring Injection types:
1) Constructor injection
2) Setter injection : Inject dependencies by calling setter method on your class.

Development Process: Constructor Injection
1) Define the dependency interface and class.
2) Create a constructor in your class for injections.
3) Configure the dependency injection in spring config file. 

Spring framework will perform operations behind the scenes for you based on information provided in config file.

How spring process your config file:

<bean id="myFortuneService"
    		class="com.sandeep.spring.HappyFortuneService">
</bean>

<bean id="myCoach"
    		class="com.sandeep.spring.BaseballCoach">
    		<constructor-arg ref="myFortuneService"/>
</bean>

//For above code spring framework will perform below code:
1) FortuneService myFortuneService = new FortuneService();
2) Coach myCoach = new Coach(myFortuneService);
