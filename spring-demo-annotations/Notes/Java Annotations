These are special labels/markers added to Java classes.
Provide meta data about the class.
Processed at compile time mostly.

Why Annotation
XML configuration can be verbose, so with annotations we can minimize xml configuration.

Once annotation is added

Spring will scan java classes for special annotations.
Automatically register the beans in the spring container.

Development process
Enable component scanning in spring config file.
<context:component-scan base-package="base package location"/>

Add the @Component Annotation to your Java classes.
@Component("bean id")
with above annotation spring will register it as bean automatically

Retrieve bean from Spring Container.
Coach coach = context.getBean("bean id",classname.class)

Default Bean ID: make first letter of class name small
