Spring Auto wiring
For dependency injection spring can use Auto wiring.

Spring will look for a class that matches property.
matches by type : class or interface

once spring finds match spring will inject automatically.

Autowiring injection types
1) Constructor Injection
2) Setter Injection
3) Field Injection

Constructor Injection: Inject dependencies by constructor.Inside bean, We use @Autowired annotation on constructor for that.
Setter Injection: Inject dependencies by calling setter methods on your class.

Method Injection: Inject dependencies by calling any method of your class. Simply give @Autowired

Field Injection:Inject dependencies by setting field values on your class directly.(Even private fields)
It happens behind the scenes by java technology Reflection.

Development process: Configure dependency with @Autowired Annotation
Applied directly to the field.
No need for setter methods.

Which injection should we use?
Choose one and stay consistent in your project
