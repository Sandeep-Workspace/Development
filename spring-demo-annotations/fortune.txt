Behind every great fortune lies a great crime.
Come what may all bad fortune is to be conquered by endurance.
Fortune and love favor the brave,Formal education will make you a living; self-education will make you a fortune.
Diligence is the mother of good fortune and idleness its opposite never brought a man to the goal of any of his best wishes.
Today is your lucky day.
Never give up.
Beware of the wolf.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
A bird in hand is better than two in a bush.
